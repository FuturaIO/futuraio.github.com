        <p class="ttitle">Social Resturant Reccomendations</p>
        <p>We teamed up with the startup Traffic to build the first version of their consumer iOS app for reviewing resurants. We love eating food, so we were all like "Nom Nom Nom"</p>
        <p>The team behind Traffic had an awesome vision for an incredibly simple product utilizing a Traffic light for giving users a more clear understanding of a reccomendation. We were honored to help bring their vision to life.</p>

        <p>The team behind Surfr had an idea for a more social surf report experience - with photos, comments and of course, thowing the Shaka all over the place. We happen to love dodging barrels ourselves and were "stoked" to start build Surfr.</p>
