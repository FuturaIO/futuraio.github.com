There have already been many great things said about the design overhaul iOS is *currently* undergoing. Just a quick share of the more thoughtful, important posts we've read that are also worth your time.

There is an abundance of great thoughts about the implications of iOS 7. We will definitely have more thoughts to share in the future and have already begun fixing Storyboards that Xcode 5 messed up. 

There is no mistaking it - iOS 7 represents a **MUCH** larger shift in product design than all the hoopla about flat. Apple is genius at designing as much for the problems users face now, as they will in the future. This overhaul is a big step into the interface transformity that iOS will have moving forward.
